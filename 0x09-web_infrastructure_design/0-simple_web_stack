When a user types www.foobar.com in their browser, the request goes to the server at IP 8.8.8.8. The server, running a LAMP stack, uses the www record in the DNS to direct the request to the Nginx web server. The web server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It then interacts with the application server, executing the necessary code to generate a response. The application server retrieves and updates data from the MySQL database as needed.

This infrastructure has some issues. Firstly, it's a Single Point of Failure (SPOF), meaning if the server goes down, so does the website. Secondly, there's potential for downtime during maintenance, like deploying new code, which requires restarting the web server. Lastly, this setup can't scale if there's too much incoming traffic, potentially causing the website to crash.
