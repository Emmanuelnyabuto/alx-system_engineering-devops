1. Three web servers, each running a web server, application server, and database.
2. Three firewalls (for protection against unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, and securing the internal network).
3. One SSL certificate for www.foobar.com (to serve traffic over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication and user data protection).
4. Three monitoring clients (to collect data for monitoring services like Sumologic, enabling real-time visibility and anomaly detection).

Monitoring is used to track the performance, availability, and security of the web infrastructure. Monitoring tools collect data through logs, metrics, and traces from the servers, network devices, and applications.

To monitor web server QPS, you can use monitoring tools to track the number of requests per second (QPS) and analyze trends, outliers, and performance issues.

Issues with this infrastructure:

1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can cause potential security risks, as it may expose the internal network to man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes can lead to a single point of failure, impacting availability and data consistency.
3. Having servers with all the same components can be problematic, as it may not allow for efficient resource utilization, and can increase the risk of correlated failures.
